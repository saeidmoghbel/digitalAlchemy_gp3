# Designing Molecules with Desired Properties

## Project Overview

This project is focusing on developing a neural network that links molecular structures to polarizability. The model can:
1. Predict polarizability from molecular structure
2. Identify molecules with target polarizability values
3. Suggest structural modifications to achieve desired properties

## Requirements

Python 3.8+
PyTorch 2.4.1
SchNetPack 2.1.1
ASE 3.23
